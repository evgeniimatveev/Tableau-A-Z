1.Copy Each Visualization: This would involve taking a screenshot of each visualization and compiling them, possibly with step-by-step explanations. This is a good approach if you want to provide a detailed guide on how each visualization is created and what it represents.

2.Step-by-Step Guide: You could create a document that not only includes screenshots but also provides a tutorial style guide through the creation of each visualization. This could be more engaging for those looking to learn Tableau.

3.Summary Overview: This would be a more condensed approach where you provide an overview of each visualization, perhaps with some key insights or learnings, and then provide the entire Tableau file for download. This allows users to explore the visualizations interactively in Tableau.

4.Entire File Upload: Simply uploading the entire Tableau workbook file (.twbx) could be beneficial for users who already have some proficiency with Tableau and can navigate through the workbook on their own.
